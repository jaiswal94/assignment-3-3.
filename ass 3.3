There major components of Hadoop 2.x are as:-
a)HDFS
b).YARN
c).MapReduce.
  MapReduce which is responsible for processing  and HDFS which is responsible for storage contain 
  both Masternode and slave node as Components.
  
  
 Master Node has two components:
1)Resource Manager(YARN or MapReduce v2)

It is a Per-Cluster Level Component and is divided into two components:
a).Scheduler-
1) It is Responsible to scheduler required resources to Applications (that is Per-Application Master).
2)It does only scheduling.
3)It does care about monitoring or tracking of those Applications.


b)Application Manager
1)Application Master is a per-application level component. It is responsible for Managing assigned Application Life cycle.
2).It interacts with both Resource Manager’s Scheduler and Node Manager
3).It interacts with Scheduler to acquire required resources.
4)It interacts with Node Manager to execute assigned tasks and monitor those task’s status.


2).Namenode-this is HDFS component and is used to store Meta data.


slave node has two components:-
1)Node Manager-
Node Manager is a Per-Node Level component which is responsible for:
a).Managing the life-cycle of the Container.
b).Monitoring each Container’s Resources utilization.

Container:

Each Master Node or Slave Node contains set of Containers. In this diagram, Main Node’s Name Node is not showing the Containers. However, it also contains a set of Containers.
Container is a portion of Memory in HDFS (Either Name Node or Data Node).


2).data node-
 Data Node is used to store actual our application Big Data.
